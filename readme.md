# Detection of Groundwater (Nappe Phréatique)

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to detect the presence of groundwater in the subsurface using data visualization and computer vision techniques.  
The project follows a two-step approach:

1. Generate and visualize subsurface resistivity data through prototype plots.  
2. Analyze the generated plots using an image processing model to detect groundwater and rank the most promising areas for exploration.
