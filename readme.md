# Detection of Groundwater (Nappe Phréatique)

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to detect the presence of groundwater in the subsurface.  
The main steps are:

1. Create a prototype graph to visualize the subsurface.  
2. Build a model to detect water and suggest the best areas to explore first (in order).
